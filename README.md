## Gitâ†”Jira Release Integration

Command line script used to analyze git commits/tags, parse out Jira ticket IDs, create Jira fix versions then update tickets with their fix version. It is designed in such a way that it can be run as an automatic step during one click deployments.

#### Requirements:
* Commit messages which contain their corresponding ticket ID. For example `TRAACKR-1234: Fixed a bug`.
* A tag for every release.
* Python 3
* Install dependencies in requirements.txt, `pip install -r requirements.txt`


## Usage

#### Arguments

| command | description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| --app | Optional app name, this is used as a helper to set the `--release-name` and `--previous-tag`. |
| --repo-path | Path to git repository |
| --release-name | Optional release name to use, if not provided the `--release-tag` is used, or if `--app` is present a computed <app>-<date> is used. |
| --release-tag | Most recent tag, start bound for commits included in release. |
| --previous-tag | Oldest tag, end bound for commits included in release. |
| --jira-base-url | Root of your jira URL, like such as `https://traackr.atlassian.net` |
| --jira-username | Login for Jira REST API. |
| --jira-password | Password for Jira REST API. |
| --jira-project | Jira project to use. |
| --commit-pattern | Regular expression using python syntax for parsing commit messages. Use `key` and `value` named groups for the Jira ticket id `key` pattern and commit message `value`. |
| --assume-yes | If provided any prompts will be defaulted to `yes`. Default value is `False`. |
| --allow-multiple-versions | Allow multiple fix versions on a single ticket. For some projects it may be desirable to have multiple fix versions attached to a single ticket. For instance a library and consumer are both modified for one feature. Default value is `False`. |
| --create-tag | This flag indicates whether or not to tag the repository with the `--release-name` after finishing.
| --dry-run | Prevents Jira modifications. Default value is `True`. |

#### example command

## Release an app
This style command is for integrating with a CI tool. All commits from the most recent until the next tag matching `skynet-*` will be considered. Those which match the commit-pattern will be validated in Jira and tagged with a fix version.
```
./release_fix_versioner.py
       --dry-run false
       --app skynet
       --create-tag
       --repo-path ~/skynet/
       --jira-base-url cyberdyne-systems.atlassian.net
       --jira-username cyberdyne
       --jira-password cyberdyne1997
       --jira-project SNAI
       --commit-pattern "(?P<key>[\w]*-[\d]*)[ :-](?P<value>.*)"
```

## Release between two tags.
This is typically done as a post-release step when releases involve a tag. In this example all commits between `rev-1.49` and `rev-1.50` are considered. Those which match the commit-pattern will be validated in Jira and tagged with a fix version.
```
./release_fix_versioner.py
       --dry-run false
       --release-name "1.50 - Stemming sentience"
       --repo-path ~/skynet/
       --release-tag rev-1.50
       --previous-tag rev-1.49
       --jira-base-url cyberdyne-systems.atlassian.net
       --jira-username cyberdyne
       --jira-password cyberdyne1997
       --jira-project SNAI
       --commit-pattern "(?P<key>[\w]*-[\d]*)[ :-](?P<value>.*)"
```
